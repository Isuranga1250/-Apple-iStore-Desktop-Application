# -Apple-iStore-Desktop-Application
I developed a Java-based desktop application for an Apple product retail store to streamline daily operations. Built with Java Swing, the system features secure login with two roles—cashier and manager. Cashiers can process orders and generate invoices, while managers can manage stock, products, and sales summaries with real-time stock updates.
